Q11 & Q13

Ans-
List and Tuple objects are sequences. 
List and tuple is an ordered collection of items.
A dictionary is a hash table of key-value pairs. Dictionary is unordered collection.
List and dictionary objects are mutable i.e. it is possible to add new item or delete and item from it. 
Tuple is an immutable object. Addition or deletion operations are not possible on tuple object.
Each of them is a collection of comma-separated items. List items are enclosed in square brackets [], tuple items in round brackets or parentheses (), and dictionary items in curly brackets {}
Set is a slightly different concept from a list or a tuple. A set, in Python, is just like the mathematical set. It does not hold duplicate values and is unordered ; not immutable, unlike a tuple.

The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument.
For example ord('A') returns 65 which is a unicode code point value of character 'A'.
type() function used to get variable data type in python.

Ans-
# ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers and a â‰  0

# Solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0

# import complex math module
import cmath

a = input("Enter number a :")
b = input("Enter number b :")
c = input("Enter number c :")

# calculate the discriminant
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

# find two solutions
solution1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
solution2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(solution1,solution2))

15)
# Sum of natural numbers up to num
num = input ("enter natural number")

# Use formula for sum calculation.
sum = num*(num+1)/2

print("The sum is", sum)
